          Norwex believes that every home should be a safe haven. Thatâ€™s why we
          constantly strive to bring you the most effective household cleaning
          and personal care products while radically reducing the use of
          chemicals in your home.


          *   Not only do our Norwex Microfiber products reduce chemicals used
          in cleaning, but our other household cleaning products do, too. These
          products contain ingredients derived from natural botanicals instead
          of harsh chemicals, and many attain their incredible cleaning power
          from enzyme-based formulas.


          *   In addition, many of our skin care products are certified by such
          highly regarded agencies as Ecocert, EcoGruppo and NaTrue, which
          ensure that ingredients are derived from renewable resources and that
          products are manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. In
          fact, Norwex is proud to be one of the few companies in North America
          to offer a complete line of Ecocert-certified products.
