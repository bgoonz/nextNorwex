And we promise with every purchase to also include peace of mind, respect for your time and a positive impact on our planet. Because at Norwex®, we not only promise to make extraordinary products—we promise to make a difference.\_[**Shop\_Now\_>**](https://shopus.norwex.biz/en_US/customer/shop/microfiber)\n\nNORWEX MICROFIBER\n\n### Safer Cleaning Starts Here\n\nMore than a quarter-century ago, a little cloth quietly started a revolution. It left every surface sparkling—and removed up to 99% of bacteria—with just plain water. Today, families around the world trust Norwex Microfiber cloths, mops and towels to clean simply, effectively and always in good conscience.\_[**Shop\_Now\_>**](https://shopus.norwex.biz/en_US/customer/shop/microfiber)\n\n### What Makes Norwex Microfiber so Unique?\n\nSelect an icon to learn how our microfiber sets the standard for performance and delivers a safer, healthier clean you can trust.\n\nRemoves up to 99%\nof bacteria\n\nNorwex® Microfiber removes up to 99% of bacteria from a surface using only water, when following proper care and use instructions.\n\nBacLock® only\nfrom Norwex®\n\nOur BacLock®\\* micro silver antibacterial agent embedded in the cloth self-cleanses it within 24 hours—drastically reducing mold, fungi and bacterial odor so the cloth stays fresher longer.\n\n\\*BacLock is our exclusive antibacterial agent for self-cleansing purposes only. The agent is solely designed to inhibit bacterial odor, mold and mildew growth within the product.\n\n1/200th the\nthickness of a\nhuman hair\n\nCommon microfiber is often made from fibers up to 1/6th the thickness of a human hair. But Norwex® Microfiber is split to 1/200th the thickness. Our super-fine, extra-dense fibers are much more absorbent and far superior at picking up bacteria, dust, dirt and grime.\n\nMechanical versus\nchemical cleaning\n\nInstead of relying on harmful chemicals that can affect your family’s health, Norwex® harnesses the physical power of our microfiber and water alone to easily and thoroughly clean any surface.\n\nSTANDARD 100\nby OEKO-TEX®\nCertification\n\nThe prestigious, independent third-party OEKO-TEX® certification on many of our microfiber products means every part of the product—from yarn and dyes to trim and label—is certified free from harmful substances.\n\nHelps the Earth\nand your budget\n\nNorwex® Microfiber enables you to eliminate not only harmful, chemical-laden cleaners, but all those expensive, single-use disposables like paper towels, floor pads and wipes. That’s great for the Earth and can save you about $600 a year.\n\nHover over each icon to find out more.\n\nHOUSEHOLD CLEANERS\n\n### Harmful Chemicals Not Included\n\nGrowing up, many of us associated “clean” with strong household cleaners and fresh fragrances. What we didn’t know was this clean came with a cost: exposure to harmful chemicals that could affect our health and the health of our children, pets and the planet. Norwex has reinvented clean—with the power of plants and natural enzymes that are toxin- and worry-free.\_[**Shop\_Now\_>**](https://shopus.norwex.biz/en_US/customer/shop/household)\n\nFACE AND BODY\n\n### Taking Personal Care Personally\n\nOf the world’s more than 85,000 chemicals, most have never been tested for their impact on human health. From hands to hair, shower to sunscreen, our clean, natural approach to personal care means you’ll never trade safety for the performance and pampering you deserve.\_[**Shop\_Now\_>**](https://shopus.norwex.biz/en_US/customer/shop/Personal_Care)\n"
