-   Norwex Microfiber has the ability to remove up to 99% of bacteria from a surface when following the proper care and use instructions.
-   Used dry for dusting, it creates static electricity that lifts the smallest particles of dust and dirt up into the cloth and prevents them from resettling on surfaces.
-   Used damp for general cleaning and heavily soiled areas, it picks up everything using water.
-   The BacLock* in the cloth---our exclusive micro silver antibacterial agent---goes to work to self-purify and inhibit odors from bacteria, mold and mildew growth within the cloth within 24 hours so that it is ready to use again.
